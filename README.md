Hello, Dear Reader 

This is my website application for the Founders and Coders Autumn 2021 cohort using vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

Important:

I have broken up the CSS classes for each section of my web application. Mainly to debug the section separately instead of having this very long and complex file. This approach made it much easier for me to manager my code effectively. 

“The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.” Lao Tzu 😊

Problem: 
1)	Using too many ID’s, making it difficult to change things due to specificity order 
2)	position absolute for the carousel not fully centred 
3)	The pause button looks okay on desktop but bad on mobile, even-though used ‘:active’ because phones cannot hover. 
4)	There are some repetitions, could have minimized code.
