          <p>
            I currently work in the healthcare sector providing care across the
            NHS, assisting those with mental/learning disability. I also
            participate in youth groups by helping individuals who are
            vulnerable in the community and providing guidance for people with
            diabetes. It has come to my attention that much of the services and
            support provided by the NHS are moving towards web development
            instead of leaflets and paper-based information. Technology plays an
            increasingly important part in the healthcare sector.
            <br />
            <br />
            One of the things I would like to do is to build a bilingual website
            designed in an easy-read format tailored to the Somali community
            regarding diabetes. Diabetes is very prevalent in the Somali
            community, especially Type 2 diabetes which has affected several of
            my family members. Although there is much information available
            online, people tend to overlook this health issue until they and/or
            a relation are diagnosed with the condition. I know that a website
            that focuses on diabetes tailored to my target audience would help
            my community and general public health efforts immensely.
            <br />
            <br />
            I often found myself researching about web development, however, I
            did not have the courage to start this journey. The process seemed
            challenging. I came across Founders and Coders which facilitated
            collaborative learning and this sped up my learning and resulted in
            my first basic HTML ‚Äúhello, world‚Äù. This is my first html
            <a
              id="myWebSiteLink"
              href="https://alisiyad9-gmail-com.trinket.io/sites/html-ea431550cf"
              title="Go to my first HTML website"
              target="_blank"
              >website</a
            >
            ( &#10232; click). It was at this moment that I realised how much I
            enjoyed the whole process.
            <br />
            <br />
            Over the past few months, my skills have improved with Founders and
            Coders through collaborative working and weekly meetups. I have not
            engaged in this style of learning before, it has transformed my view
            on alternative learning. I cannot express how much knowledge I have
            gained from these sessions. I have come out of my shell, I am able
            to ask questions with no fear, even when I feel shy.
            <br />
            <br />
            <a
              >The main reason I am applying for the Autumn FAC 2021 is the fact
              that I thoroughly enjoy the problem-solving aspect that comes with
              coding. I have dedicated time and effort by learning from others
              and vice versa. Growing with other people in coding has helped me
              realise and appreciate the philosophy of Founders and Coders. I
              would be privileged to be a part of this programme and to also
              help and support others in their journey.</a
