          <p>
            I currently work in the healthcare sector providing care across NHS,
            assisting those with mental/learning disability needs. I take an
            active role in bespoke individualised and group therapy, assessments
            and by helping service users' progress to the least restrictive
            setting possible. I also participate in youth groups to help
            individuals who are vulnerable in the community and guidance for
            people with diabetes. <br />
            <br />

            It has come to my attention, much of the services and support
            provided by the NHS is moving to web develop instead of leaflets and
            paper-based information. Technology plans an important part in the
            healthcare sector, I often found myself researching about web
            development however did not have courage to start the journey due to
            the process seeming daunting. However, this changed when I wrote in
            basic HTML ‚Äúhello, world‚Äù üòä. It was at this moment that I realised
            how much I enjoyed the whole process. I have since then encouraged
            young adult to use this as a tool to up skill themselves and
            eventually have a career. first html

            >
            only using HTML AND CSS. <br />
            <br />
            My skills have further improved with Founder and Coders over the
            months through the collaborative working and weekly meetups. I can
            not express how much knowledge I gained from these sessions. This
            also meant I had to come out of my shell and not to be afraid to ask
            questions, even at times felt shy but people changed my expectation
            by giving great feedback. I have not done this time of learning
            before and has honestly transformed my view on learning. I also
            learned the importance of readable code is far more important then
            solving the problem at hand, in addition to sharing your knowledge.

              >This is the main reason I am applying for the Autumn FAC 2021
              having dedicated time and effort by learning from others and vice
              versa. Growing with other people in coding has helped me realise
              and appreciate the philosophy of Coders and Founders group
              learning. I would be happy to be part of this programme and
              helping and supporting other in their journey</span
